# AdventOfCodeMW

### Description

[Advent-of-code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_of_Code) in simple language is a yearly challenge
where one solves a coding question each day from 1st December till the 25th of December.

The conventional challenges are a two part series where solving the first part gives
a key to open the second part.

Partaking in the Advent-of-code might seem dull, boring or time-wasting from afar but its benefiting once you delve into it.  
Apart from sharpening your already existing skills, it builds a sense of community and it even a networking opportunity.

This might be an opportunity to try out that language you have been shying away. [check out this video by Theo on aoc](https://youtu.be/ddLbE9aGHno?si=IIrCjFuEFk8HqnLE)

### HOW IS THIS AOC DIFFERENT

There will be alot of differences with the conventional AOC.

#### Questions will be submitted by contributers

- If you saw an interesting question on leetcode or anywhere. [Email me](mtendekuyokwa19@gmail.com) The question and I will add it to the list as some days are not populated with any questions.

- You are open to fishing a question from the previous years of AOC.

#### No LeaderBoard

- Having a leaderBoard and giving out points is cool but this is not the main goal of this AOC. It is simply a learning opportunity.

### RULES

1. No AI generated code. It is OK to use AI to digest the question but using it to write the
   code for you is not allowed.
